## My process

- Firstly i thought of making this peoject with React but then afterwards i realized that using vanilla JS will further improve my core JS concepts, so i did the same.
- I also made use of AI initially for getting the UI right(responsive).
- The core logic and functionality was written purely by me using vanilla JS.
- After getting the initial UI of countries grid correctly, i proceeded for routing.
- Routing using JS was challenging initially but after learning it, i made details-page of each country
- Then moved to writing search and filter functionallity whicj was pretty easy.
- Lastly the Dark and light mode was quite challenging as there were many bugs.
- Fixed those bugs with some help of AI and finally deployed it.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS


### What I learned

Vanilla JS routing and theme switching logic.
